- receiving data from Lovense API through callback URL and forward data to SL app
- example for sending vibration command to toys 

what you need
- Lovense developer token (without this example won't work for you!)
- external webserver with PHP to host callback.php to receive JSON data from Lovense API and forward it to your SL app
